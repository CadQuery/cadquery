CadQuery API Reference
***********************

The CadQuery API is made up of 2 main objects:

* **Workplane** -- Wraps a topological entity and provides a 2-D modelling context.
* **Selector** -- Filter and select things

This page lists  methods of these objects grouped by **functional area**

Initialization
----------------

.. currentmodule:: cadquery

Creating new workplanes and object chains

.. autosummary::
    Workplane


.. _2dOperations:

2-d Operations
-----------------

Creating 2-d constructs that can be used to create 3 d features.

All 2-d operations require a **Workplane** object to be created.

.. currentmodule:: cadquery

.. autosummary::
    Workplane.center
	Workplane.lineTo
	Workplane.line
	Workplane.vLine
	Workplane.vLineTo
	Workplane.hLine
	Workplane.moveTo
	Workplane.move
	Workplane.spline
	Workplane.parametricCurve
	Workplane.threePointArc
	Workplane.sagittaArc
	Workplane.radiusArc
    Workplane.tangentArcPoint
	Workplane.rotateAndCopy
	Workplane.mirrorY
	Workplane.mirrorX
	Workplane.wire
	Workplane.rect
	Workplane.circle
	Workplane.ellipse
	Workplane.ellipseArc
	Workplane.polyline
	Workplane.close
	Workplane.rarray
	Workplane.polarArray
	Workplane.slot2D
	Workplane.offset2D

.. _3doperations:

3-d Operations
-----------------

Some 3-d operations also require an active 2-d workplane, but some do not.

3-d operations that require a 2-d workplane to be active:

.. autosummary::
	Workplane.cboreHole
	Workplane.cskHole
	Workplane.hole
	Workplane.extrude
	Workplane.cut
	Workplane.cutBlind
	Workplane.cutThruAll
	Workplane.box
	Workplane.sphere
	Workplane.union
	Workplane.combine
	Workplane.intersect
	Workplane.loft
	Workplane.sweep
	Workplane.twistExtrude
	Workplane.revolve
	Workplane.text
	

3-d operations that do NOT require a 2-d workplane to be active:

.. autosummary::
	Workplane.shell
	Workplane.fillet
	Workplane.chamfer
	Workplane.split
	Workplane.rotate
	Workplane.rotateAboutCenter
	Workplane.translate
	Workplane.mirror

File Management and Export
---------------------------------

.. autosummary::
    Workplane.toSvg
    Workplane.exportSvg


.. autosummary::
    importers.importStep
    importers.importDXF
    exporters.export


Iteration Methods
------------------

Methods that allow iteration over the stack or objects

.. autosummary::
    Workplane.each
    Workplane.eachpoint


.. _stackMethods:

Stack and Selector Methods
------------------------------

CadQuery methods that operate on the stack

.. autosummary::
	Workplane.all
	Workplane.size
	Workplane.vals
	Workplane.add
	Workplane.val
	Workplane.first
	Workplane.item
	Workplane.last
	Workplane.end
	Workplane.vertices
	Workplane.faces
	Workplane.edges
	Workplane.wires
	Workplane.solids
	Workplane.shells
	Workplane.compounds

.. _selectors:

Selectors
------------------------

Objects that filter and select CAD objects. Selectors are used to select existing geometry
as a basis for futher operations.

.. currentmodule:: cadquery

.. autosummary::

        NearestToPointSelector
        BoxSelector
        BaseDirSelector
        ParallelDirSelector
        DirectionSelector
        DirectionNthSelector
        PerpendicularDirSelector
        TypeSelector
        DirectionMinMaxSelector
        BinarySelector
        AndSelector
        SumSelector
        SubtractSelector
        InverseSelector
        StringSyntaxSelector
        
Assemblies
----------

Workplane and Shape objects can be connected together into assemblies

.. currentmodule:: cadquery

.. autosummary::

        Assembly
        Assembly.add
        Assembly.save
        Assembly.constrain
        Constraint
        Color
