CadQuery Documentation
===================================

CadQuery is an intuitive, easy-to-use python library for building parametric 3D CAD models.  It has several goals:

    * Build models with scripts that are as close as possible to how you'd describe the object to a human,
      using a standard, already established programming language

    * Create parametric models that can be very easily customized by end users

    * Output high quality CAD formats like STEP and AMF in addition to traditional STL

    * Provide a non-proprietary, plain text model format that can be edited and executed with only a web browser
