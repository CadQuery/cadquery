String Selectors Reference
=============================


CadQuery selector strings allow filtering various types of object lists. Most commonly, Edges, Faces, and Vertices are
used, but all objects types can be filtered.

String selectors are simply shortcuts for using the full object equivalents. If you pass one of the
string patterns in, CadQuery will automatically use the associated selector object.

    * :py:meth:`cadquery.Workplane.edges`
    * :py:meth:`cadquery.Workplane.vertices`
    * :py:meth:`cadquery.Workplane.solids`
    * :py:meth:`cadquery.Workplane.shells`

.. note::

    String selectors are shortcuts to concrete selector classes, which you can use or extend. See
    :ref:`classreference` for more details

    If you find that the built-in selectors are not sufficient, you can easily plug in your own.
    See :ref:`extending` to see how.


Combining Selectors
==========================

Selectors can be combined logically, currently defined operators include **and**, **or**, **not** and **exc[ept]** (set difference).  For example:

.. cadquery::

    result = cq.Workplane("XY").box(2, 2, 2) \
        .edges("|Z and >Y") \
        .chamfer(0.2)

Much more complex expressions are possible as well:

.. cadquery::

    result = cq.Workplane("XY").box(2, 2, 2) \
        .faces(">Z") \
        .shell(-0.2) \
        .faces(">Z") \
        .edges("not(<X or >X or <Y or >Y)") \
        .chamfer(0.1)

.. _filteringfaces:

Filtering Faces
----------------

All types of filters work on faces.  In most cases, the selector refers to the direction of the **normal vector**
of the face.

.. warning::

    If a face is not planar, selectors are evaluated at the center of mass of the face. This can lead
    to results that are quite unexpected.

The axis used in the listing below are for illustration: any axis would work similarly in each case.

.. _filteringedges:

Filtering Edges
----------------

Some filter types are not supported for edges.  The selector usually refers to the **direction** of the edge.

.. warning::

    Non-linear edges are not selected for any selectors except type (%). Non-linear edges are never returned
    when these filters are applied.

The axis used in the listing below are for illustration: any axis would work similarly in each case.

.. _filteringvertices:

Filtering Vertices

Only a few of the filter types apply to vertices. The location of the vertex is the subject of the filter

=========   =======================================    =======================================================     ==========================

User-defined Directions
-----------------------

It is possible to use user defined vectors as a basis for the selectors. For example:

.. cadquery::

    result = cq.Workplane("XY").box(10,10,10)

    # chamfer only one edge
    result = result.edges('>(-1,1,0)').chamfer(1)
