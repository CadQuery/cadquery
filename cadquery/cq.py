        The first element on the stack must be a face, a set of
        co-planar faces or a vertex.  If a vertex, then the parent
        item on the chain immediately before the vertex must be a
        face.

        The result will be a 2-d working plane
        with a new coordinate system set up as follows:

           * The origin will be located in the *center* of the
             face/faces, if a face/faces was selected. If a vertex was
             selected, the origin will be at the vertex, and located
             on the face.
           * The Z direction will be normal to the plane of the face,computed
             at the center point.
           * The X direction will be parallel to the x-y plane. If the workplane is  parallel to
             the global x-y plane, the x direction of the workplane will co-incide with the
             global x direction.

        Most commonly, the selected face will be planar, and the workplane lies in the same plane
        of the face ( IE, offset=0).  Occasionally, it is useful to define a face offset from
        an existing surface, and even more rarely to define a workplane based on a face that is
        not planar.

        To create a workplane without first having a face, use the Workplane() method.

        Future Enhancements:
          * Allow creating workplane from planar wires
          * Allow creating workplane based on an arbitrary point on a face, not just the center.
            For now you can work around by creating a workplane and then offsetting the center

        disable this behavior with `clean=False` parameter if method

        the shape is 'simplified' at each step and thus next operation
        is easier.
