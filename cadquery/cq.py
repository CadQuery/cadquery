        The first element on the stack must be a face, a set of
        co-planar faces or a vertex.  If a vertex, then the parent
        item on the chain immediately before the vertex must be a
        face.

        The result will be a 2-d working plane
        with a new coordinate system set up as follows:

           * The origin will be located in the *center* of the
             face/faces, if a face/faces was selected. If a vertex was
             selected, the origin will be at the vertex, and located
             on the face. The centerOption paramter sets how the center is defined.
             Options are 'CenterOfMass', 'CenterOfBoundBox', or 'ProjectedOrigin'.
             'CenterOfMass' and 'CenterOfBoundBox' are in relation to the selected
             face/faces. 'ProjectedOrigin' uses the current planes origin by default
             or can be specified as an arbitrary point using the optional origin
             parameter.
           * The Z direction will be normal to the plane of the face,computed
             at the center point.
           * The X direction will be parallel to the x-y plane. If the workplane is  parallel to
             the global x-y plane, the x direction of the workplane will co-incide with the
             global x direction.

        Most commonly, the selected face will be planar, and the workplane lies in the same plane
        of the face ( IE, offset=0).  Occasionally, it is useful to define a face offset from
        an existing surface, and even more rarely to define a workplane based on a face that is
        not planar.

        To create a workplane without first having a face, use the Workplane() method.

        Future Enhancements:
          * Allow creating workplane from planar wires
          * Allow creating workplane based on an arbitrary point on a face, not just the center.
            For now you can work around by creating a workplane and then offsetting the center
            afterwards.
