# 1.  Establishes a workplane that an object can be built on.
# 1a. Uses the X and Y origins to define the workplane, meaning that the
# positive Z direction is "up", and the negative Z direction is "down".
# 2.  The highest(max) Z face is selected and a new workplane is created on it.
# 3.  The new workplane is used to drill a hole through the block.
# 3a. The hole is automatically centered in the workplane.
# 4.  The highest(max) Z face is selected and a new workplane is created on it.
# 5.  A for-construction rectangle is created on the workplane based on the
#     block's overall dimensions.
# 5a. For-construction objects are used only to place other geometry, they
#     do not show up in the final displayed geometry.
# 6.  The vertices of the rectangle (corners) are selected, and a counter-bored
#     hole is placed at each of the vertices (all 4 of them at once).
