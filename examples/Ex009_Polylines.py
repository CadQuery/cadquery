# We generate half of the I-beam outline and then mirror it to create the full
# I-beam.
# 1.  Establishes a workplane that an object can be built on.
# 1a. Uses the named plane orientation "front" to define the workplane, meaning
#     that the positive Z direction is "up", and the negative Z direction
#     is "down".
# 2.  moveTo() is used to move the first point from the origin (0, 0) to
#     (0, 10.0), with 10.0 being half the height (H/2.0). If this is not done
#     the first line will start from the origin, creating an extra segment that
#     will cause the extrude to have an invalid shape.
# 3.  The polyline function takes a list of points and generates the lines
#     through all the points at once.
# 3.  Only half of the I-beam profile has been drawn so far. That half is
#     mirrored around the Y-axis to create the complete I-beam profile.
# 4.  The I-beam profile is extruded to the final length of the beam.
