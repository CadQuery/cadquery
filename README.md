## What is CadQuery

CadQuery is an intuitive, easy-to-use python module for building parametric 3D CAD models. Using CadQuery, you can write short, simple scripts that produce high quality CAD models. It is easy to make many different objects using a single script that can be customized.

PLACEHOLDER (something about OPENCASCADE and its capabilities and why is it so much better than OpenSCAD / CGAL).

### Features
* Build 3d models with scripts that are as close as possible to how you'd describe the object to a human.
* Create parametric models that can be very easily customized by end users
* Output high quality (loss-less) CAD formats like STEP in addition to STL and AMF
* Provide a non-proprietary, plain text model format that can be edited and executed with only a web browser
* PLACEHOLDER - something about advanced modeling capbilities: fillets, extrudes, lofts

## Getting started

It is currently possible to use CadQuery for your own projects in 4 different ways:
* using CQ editor GUI
* from a Jupyter notebook 
* using a Docker image [is this still supported?]
* as a standalone library

The easiest way to install CadQuery and its dependancies is using conda:
```
conda install -c conda-forge -c cadquery cadquery
```

PLACEHOLDER - maybe mention the conda-packages repo for interested readers.

### GUI

### Jupyter
